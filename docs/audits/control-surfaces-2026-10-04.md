# Complete control surface audit

Reviewed on 4 October 2026 for the owner's organization-wide control task.

## Implementation

This directory repository has no separately deployed interface. Only the reviewed core standards snapshot and its documented source pin changed. Project records and ownership data were preserved.

## Approved standards

The offline installer applied the reviewed bundle from agent-standards commit `00fd107bfc651d4eb9cf7f34cf5e0a9f2ee93ee9`, digest `efe05f654da53716186663ff3186623e521003fbc82eedc624a4c46d0cc8adef`. Installation plans and doctor reports remain under the standards repository's ignored output. The imported owner-instruction block and owned snapshot were updated through that installer. Runtime Codex skill discovery remains NOT_RUN.

## Verification scope

Source, snapshot integrity, licensing and unit checks passed. A website/browser build is NOT_APPLICABLE for this repository.

## Publication and limits

Source checks and unit tests passed before commit. Website build and deployment are NOT_APPLICABLE for this repository. Exact-commit CI, deployment status and actual published-page inspection are recorded separately in `agent-standards/output/control-surfaces-final.json` and the QR Generator checkout's `output/control-surfaces-live-chromium.json` after publication. Do not infer deployed status from a local build.

The surface guard is structural, not a visual or accessibility certification. This audit uses browser emulation, not physical devices or a screen reader. Native file-selection, print and permission dialogs belong to the browser or operating system. System controls are a deliberate forced-colors fallback, not the normal-theme design.
